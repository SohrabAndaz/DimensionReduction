/*
The Exposure Matrix is a matrix which maps from your factors to your market variabeles. Let y be a vector of market variables, x be a vector comprised of a market factor and a additive constant, and A be the exposure matrix. Then:
 
    Y=Ax
 
    Just for illustration, x is written out as:
    x={1,F}^T, where F is the factor. (The ^T just means transpose. x is a column vector)
 
    The Exposure object is fed  an array of market data (stored as DataOrganizers) and a factor (stored as a factor organizer). The componenets of the exposure matrix can be tweaked and augmented â€” or they can simply be optimized to maximize the R square value between the actual market distribution and the estimated (or caluclated) distribution given by the matrix product between the matrix and the factor.
